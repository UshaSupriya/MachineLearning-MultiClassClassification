It's a 6 class classification data. This dataset is taken from Kaggle website
We have to classify testdata into one of the six classes:
1. LAYING               
2. STANDING            
3. SITTING               
4. WALKING              
5. WALKING_UPSTAIRS      
6. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

Logistic Regression and SVM worked better than other algorithms
